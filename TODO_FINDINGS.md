# Codebase TODOs, Stubs, and Examples

This document serves as a centralized location for tracking all TODOs, stubbed implementations, and examples found throughout the codebase. As various subtasks analyze different parts of the project, their findings will be appended to this file under appropriate section headers.

This approach allows us to:
- Maintain a comprehensive overview of incomplete implementations
- Track planned features and improvements
- Document example code that may need review or refactoring
- Coordinate efforts across multiple developers or subtasks

Each finding should include:
- The file path where the item was found
- A brief description of the TODO/stub/example
- Any relevant context or notes
- The date the item was identified (optional)


## src/lib/api/

### client.ts
- No TODOs, stubs, or example code found
- File contains a complete implementation of an API client with:
  - Base request handling
  - Type-safe API endpoints
  - Error handling
  - Specific implementations for LLM and statements APIs

The API client implementation appears complete with no outstanding TODOs or placeholder code.


## src/lib/server/

### 1. TODO Comments Found

#### src/lib/server/llm/nodes/extractStatements.ts
- **Line 39-40**: TODO for token tracking callback implementation
- **Line 55**: TODO for adding token tracking callback to callbacks array

### 2. Example Files

#### src/lib/server/llm/costTracking/
- **integrationExample.ts**: Example implementation of token tracking integration
- **errorHandlingExample.ts**: Example error handling patterns
- **langchainIntegrationExample.ts**: Example LangChain.js integration
- **realtimeCostExample.ts**: Example real-time cost calculation
- **IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md**: Documentation of implemented features with integration examples

### 3. Stubbed Implementations

#### src/lib/server/llm/nodes/extractStatements.ts
- **Lines 8-11**: Commented-out example of token tracking integration
- **Lines 54-55**: Commented-out token tracking callback in callbacks array

### 4. Future Integration Points (from IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md)
- Update LLM nodes to use TokenTrackingService
- Pass user and analysis IDs through workflow state
- Add token tracking callbacks to LLM chain invocations
- Integrate cost calculations with balance service
- Add usage summaries to analysis results
### 5. Database Implementations
All database repositories appear fully implemented with:
- CRUD operations
- Transaction-like operations
- Error handling
- Type safety


## src/routes/

### 1. TODO Comments Found

#### src/routes/auth/+page.svelte
- **Line 37-38**: TODO for implementing email/password authentication
- Currently has placeholder console.log message
- This is the main authentication page's sign-in functionality

### 2. Other Findings
- All other route handlers appear fully implemented
- No stubbed or example implementations found in route files
- API endpoints have complete implementations with proper error handling
