# Stripe Integration Security Considerations

## 1. Overview

Security is paramount in payment processing systems. This document outlines the security measures and considerations for the Stripe integration.

## 2. API Key Management

### 2.1 Secret Key Protection

- **Never expose secret keys to the frontend**: All Stripe API calls using secret keys must be made from server-side code
- **Environment variables**: Store Stripe secret keys in environment variables, not in source code
- **Access control**: Limit access to secret keys to only necessary services and personnel
- **Key rotation**: Implement a process for regular key rotation

### 2.2 Publishable Key Usage

- **Frontend usage**: Publishable keys are safe to use in frontend code for collecting payment information
- **Limited scope**: Publishable keys have limited permissions and cannot perform sensitive operations

### 2.3 Environment Separation

- **Separate keys for environments**: Use different Stripe accounts or API keys for development, staging, and production
- **Test mode**: Use Stripe's test mode in non-production environments
- **Webhook endpoints**: Configure different webhook endpoints for each environment

## 3. Webhook Security

### 3.1 Signature Verification

- **Mandatory verification**: All webhook requests must have their signatures verified using the webhook secret
- **Secure storage**: Store webhook secrets in environment variables
- **Immediate validation**: Verify signatures before processing any webhook data

### 3.2 Replay Protection

- **Idempotency**: Implement idempotency checks to prevent duplicate processing of the same event
- **Event tracking**: Track processed event IDs to prevent replay attacks
- **Time limits**: Expire tracked event IDs after a reasonable period

### 3.3 HTTPS Requirement

- **Mandatory HTTPS**: Webhook endpoints must only accept HTTPS connections
- **Certificate validation**: Ensure proper SSL certificate validation

## 4. Data Protection

### 4.1 Sensitive Data Handling

- **No card data storage**: Never store credit card numbers, CVC codes, or other sensitive payment information
- **Tokenization**: Use Stripe's tokenization to handle sensitive data
- **PII protection**: Minimize storage of personally identifiable information

### 4.2 Database Security

- **Encryption at rest**: Ensure database encryption for sensitive fields
- **Access controls**: Implement proper database access controls and permissions
- **Audit logging**: Log access to payment-related data

### 4.3 Data Transmission

- **TLS encryption**: All data transmission must use TLS 1.2 or higher
- **Secure headers**: Implement appropriate security headers for API responses

## 5. Authentication and Authorization

### 5.1 User Authentication

- **Supabase Auth**: Leverage existing Supabase authentication for user identification
- **Session validation**: Validate user sessions for all payment-related operations
- **Token expiration**: Implement appropriate token expiration policies

### 5.2 Service-to-Service Authentication

- **Role-based access**: Implement role-based access controls for payment services
- **Service accounts**: Use service accounts with minimal required permissions
- **Audit trails**: Maintain audit trails for all service operations

### 5.3 Authorization Checks

- **User ownership**: Verify that users can only access their own payment data
- **Operation permissions**: Check permissions for each payment operation
- **Rate limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse

## 6. PCI Compliance

### 6.1 Scope Minimization

- **Outsource card processing**: Use Stripe's hosted payment pages or Elements to minimize PCI scope
- **No direct card handling**: Never directly handle raw card data in the application
- **Tokenization**: Use Stripe tokens instead of raw card data

### 6.2 SAQ Requirements

- **SAQ A**: If using Stripe Checkout or Elements, likely qualify for the simplest SAQ
- **Self-assessment**: Complete annual PCI self-assessment questionnaire
- **External testing**: Engage qualified security assessors for validation

## 7. Rate Limiting and Abuse Prevention

### 7.1 API Rate Limiting

- **Request throttling**: Implement rate limiting on payment API endpoints
- **Burst protection**: Protect against sudden bursts of requests
- **User-specific limits**: Apply per-user rate limits

### 7.2 Fraud Prevention

- **Velocity checks**: Monitor for unusual payment patterns
- **Geographic restrictions**: Implement geographic restrictions if appropriate
- **Transaction limits**: Set maximum transaction amounts

## 8. Monitoring and Logging

### 8.1 Security Logging

- **Comprehensive logging**: Log all payment-related operations
- **Sensitive data exclusion**: Exclude sensitive data from logs
- **Log retention**: Implement appropriate log retention policies

### 8.2 Monitoring

- **Real-time alerts**: Set up alerts for suspicious activities
- **Anomaly detection**: Implement anomaly detection for payment patterns
- **Performance monitoring**: Monitor API performance and error rates

### 8.3 Audit Trails

- **Complete audit trail**: Maintain complete audit trails for all payment transactions
- **Immutable logs**: Use immutable logging where possible
- **Regular audits**: Conduct regular security audits

## 9. Error Handling Security

### 9.1 Information Disclosure

- **Generic error messages**: Avoid exposing internal system details in error messages
- **Logging vs. response**: Log detailed errors but return generic messages to users
- **Stack trace protection**: Never expose stack traces to end users

### 9.2 Input Validation

- **Sanitization**: Sanitize all user inputs
- **Validation**: Validate all inputs before processing
- **Type safety**: Use strong typing to prevent injection attacks

## 10. Incident Response

### 10.1 Breach Response

- **Incident plan**: Maintain an incident response plan for security breaches
- **Notification procedures**: Implement procedures for notifying affected users
- **Regulatory compliance**: Ensure compliance with data breach notification laws

### 10.2 Forensics

- **Evidence preservation**: Preserve evidence in case of security incidents
- **Chain of custody**: Maintain chain of custody for digital evidence
- **Post-incident analysis**: Conduct post-incident analysis to prevent recurrence
