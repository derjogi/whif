			"text": "OpenSource Software and Public Goods are incredibly valuable, but people spending their time on these don't get money.\nI propose that we create some sort of consortium that continually assesses projects in these areas, and makes money available to these projects based on the expected outcome. \nThis consortium should have access to government funds (government can create as much money as desired for this consortium according to MMT), and they should consist either of a range of randomly selected people, or any other larger group that is somewhat representative of the population. The group size should be big enough as to make sure the group isn't easily 'bought' or influenced.\nThe money the group makes available would be given in small-ish increments depending on need; e.g. similar to a salary, and would continue based on proof of implementation. In some situations, where there is a larger upfront investment necessary, this can also be granted.\n\nThe consortium itself would also be given a fair amount of compensation depending on the number of projects they assess."
